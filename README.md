## Clinical AI Workflows for Medical Imaging

I am a clinical professor and interventional radiologist with a strong academic interest in artificial intelligence and its practical integration into medical imaging workflows.

This GitHub profile documents my ongoing transition into applied machine learning from a clinical background. The repositories here primarily function as **reusable research templates** designed to support reproducible model development, structured evaluation, and deployment-oriented thinking.

While these projects do not aim to represent expert-level software engineering, they reflect a pragmatic, clinician-centered approach to building AI systems that can eventually support real-world healthcare environments.

## Why This Work Exists

Clinicians are increasingly expected to understand — and meaningfully participate in — the development of intelligent systems that will shape the future of medicine. However, the technical barrier to entry can appear prohibitively high for physicians without formal training in computer science.

These repositories are part of my effort to demonstrate that:

> **A practicing clinician can learn to design, build, and critically evaluate AI systems through structured and persistent learning.**

If you are a physician, trainee, or imaging professional exploring medical AI, I hope these projects provide both practical guidance and encouragement.

## Research Focus

My current computational interests include:

- Medical image segmentation  
- Imaging-based predictive modeling  
- Clinically deployable inference pipelines  
- Reproducible AI workflows  
- Evaluation methodology and error analysis  
- Workflow efficiency through intelligent systems  

All projects are developed with an emphasis on **translational relevance** rather than purely technical novelty.

## Design Philosophy

Across repositories, I prioritize:

- Clarity over cleverness  
- Reproducibility over convenience  
- Evaluation over anecdote  
- Deployment awareness from the start  
- Documentation that supports future learners  

The goal is not merely to train models, but to build **durable research infrastructure**.

## Academic Perspective

Artificial intelligence in medicine should not remain exclusively within the domain of engineers. Clinicians bring essential context regarding:

- clinical validity  
- workflow integration  
- patient safety  
- interpretability  
- real-world constraints  

Bridging clinical expertise with computational methods is, in my view, one of the most important academic responsibilities for modern physician–scientists.

## A Note to Clinicians Considering AI

You do not need to be a formally trained programmer to engage deeply with artificial intelligence.

What is required is curiosity, rigor, and a willingness to learn systematically.

The distance between clinician and computational investigator is far smaller than it may initially appear.
